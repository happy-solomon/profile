				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After  long desire to pursue an ICT carrier in my life,<a href="http://ciu.ac.ug/"> Clarke International University</a> has stood the test of time as far as applied information computer technology and leadership skills are concerned.since joining, I have learned a lot in several aspects.</p>
<p>Unlike other Universities, lectures at CIU are more interactive,practical,logical and enjoyable.It not a sit and listen but every one participate to ensure team spirit and creativity.</p>
<p>It all started on orientation day where we were encouraged  to identify our area of weakness,strongest area and future aspiration in order to be set both in tool,skill and mind.</p>
<p><strong>WEEK ONE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to programming</strong></p>
<p>This is where I learned about programming language called html [hypertext transfer markup language] which needs environments such as sublime and visual studios.</p>
<p><strong>Visual design</strong></p>
<p>In order my website to be impressive, it has to be organised under visual design principles such as;</p>
<p>Contrast:this en tells how words,colors and size can be compared on the image or website.</p>
<p>Reputation:how many times elements have been used in the website.</p>
<p>Alignment:how are the arrangements of the contents for-instances in the left,right or center,bottom or up since the website contains header,body and footer sections.</p>
<p>Proximity:contents of the same message should be allocated together.</p>
<p><strong>Css style</strong></p>
<p>I used css to style up a sign up form and tables.</p>
<p><strong>Typing skills</strong>.</p>
<p>Typing speedily without looking at the keyboard which is steadily progressing.</p>
<p><strong>WEEK TWO</strong></p>
<p><strong>Word press</strong></p>
<p>This is a website builder that helps individuals or groups develop their own websites using word press.I created a data base and  local host web by use of a dashboard and browser.the web site consists of a header,footer and body.themes,xampp,plugins are useful in website design.I can link using URL.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership skills</strong></p>
<p>leadership development through engagement.As the fact leader are made,I accept that;you must lead yourself before leading other peoples.to be a transformation leader who aims at purpose goal,I have to live a thinking and achieving d emission.</p>
<p>A leader is the one who decisively do things right by being creative,competent and self disciplined.I can fore see to be able to come up with the possible solutions for problems around our communities</p>
<p>A leader listens every one regardless of their differences.From this perspective,new solutions and innovations germinate because a leader leads for the benefit of others but not for the enrichment of  themselves .</p>
<p>I have acquired communication skills to talk as a leader.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>A leader is a path finder. God is a path maker</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Build your relationship with God to find his way through.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>To know more: <a href="http://www.ccr.org.uk/">Cat</a></em></strong><strong><em><a href="http://www.ccr.org.uk/">holic charismatic renewal</a></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>WEEK THREE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Version control</strong></p>
<p>This is a system that records changes to a file time after time.</p>
<p>There are two types of version control systems; Centralized where changes are directly made to central repository and distributed where changes are made on private repositories or window operating system such as github and later is pushed to the main branch.</p>
<p><strong>Version control tools and systems: </strong></p>
<p>Git and Github. Being a tool  and a system, this helped me to sign up with github that joins us together as gists to work on big projects from all over the world after creating a repository or fork.</p>
<p><strong>WEEK FOUR</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voice of a customer.</strong></p>
<p>This is I can capture customer&#8217;s expectation.a customer can be a buyer,user,decider,initiator,lodge keeper or influence.By these three dimensions of characters such as:bold creativity,emphatic and self discipline,I can be able to know customer value,creating customer value,measuring customer value and pricing and communicating customer value.</p>
<p>I can observe a customer with content, intuition and emotion and actively listen by silence, confirming and eye contact.By identifying the situation of a customer,big idea and explanation,I can persuade them to buy.</p>
<p>Design thinking has helped me to know how I can engage every one to come up with the best solution for a particular problem and how knew ideas can supported by management.</p>
